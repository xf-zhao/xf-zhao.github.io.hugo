I am going to present our <a href="../../publications/matcha-agent/">Matcha agent</a> paper in <a href="https://ieee-iros.org/">IROS 2023</a> Oct. It is about LLM+Robotics. See you in Detroit! :smile: In short, we have created the *Matcha agent*, comprising an LLM and multiple multimodal modules, enabling the robot to engage with its surroundings through advanced high-level LLM planning.
