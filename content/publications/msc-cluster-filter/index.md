Passive radar, which uses a third-party radiation source signal for moving target detection, plays a vital role in present and future electronic warfare. It usually uses the correlation detection method, but the reference signal is often accompanied by multi-path clutter interference. Simulation results show that multi-path clutter in the reference signal reduces the performance of target detection, increases the false alarm, and lifts the detection base. So suppressing multipath clutter is the main problem. In this paper, the principle of suppressing multipath clutter using k-forward prediction algorithm is given, and the filtering is realized based on least mean square error criterion. The simulation and real-life data results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
